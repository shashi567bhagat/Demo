/*  java Arithmetic Operators
    Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations on variables and data. For example,
 * 
 * Here, the + operator is used to add two variables a and b. Similarly, there are various other arithmetic operators in Java.

         Operator	    Operation
   
           +	        Addition
           -	        Subtraction
           *	        Multiplication
           /	        Division
           %	        Modulo Operation (Remainder after division)
           
           % Modulo Operator

           The modulo operator % computes the remainder. When a = 7 is divided by b = 4, the remainder is 3.
           Note: The % operator is mainly used with integers.
